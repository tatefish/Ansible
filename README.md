# The Ansible - a Space Data Based Synthesizer
Hello! This repository contains the files used to generate the audio samples (MATLAB), the audio sample itself ("cmbr_5year.wav"), and the SuperCollider files required to play with the data. 

The data used in this project is from the collected results of WMAP data, published [here](https://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/news/5yr_release.html), courtesy NASA/WMAP Science Team. 

## Setup 


### Desktop installation
Follow download links included on [SuperCollider's website](https://supercollider.github.io/) in order to install SuperCollider on your device. Once installed, you can directly load the .scd files into the IDE. 

### RasPi4 installation
Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/blob/develop/README_RASPBERRY_PI.md) to install SuperCollider onto your Raspberry Pi. Note that the included .scd files utilize the GUI framework that SuperCollider uses.
